For example, the    "category" column of the "products" table might have a label of "Product Category."    <p></p><p><li>"help" is displayed below the column label, and helps describe the purpose ofthe field to the user.<p></p><p><li>"help url" can be used to link to a page giving more information on the field.<p></p><p>  <li>"lookup" can be used when a field is acting like a foreign key into another    table. In that case, you'll probably want to use some sort of select box as    the widget type, and if you want to reference multiple rows in the destination    table, you'll probably want to use a multi-select box, with "colons_to_null"    as the pre_filter, and "::" as the lookup_exclude.    <p></p><p><li>"filter" and "pre_filter" can be used to filter data destined for that fieldor data read from that field, respectively.<p></p></ul>

import.main	Table Import	<p>The <b>Table Import</b> page allows you to upload a file from your computerto Interchange in order to update one of Interchange's internal tables. Thiscan be done in one of several formats -- TAB-delimited text, Gnumeric simple text,or Excel XLS workbook.</p><p>You can import slices of a table -- the only column that is required isthe key column (for example, <B>sku</B> is usually the key column for<i>products</i> and <i>inventory</i>).<P>For instance, to update only the quantityfor a series of items in <i>inventory</i>, create a file with two columns, the<B>sku</B> and <B>quantity</b>. Not all items must be updated, so you canjust upload the ones to be added or changed.</p><p>If you wish rows to be added when a new key is found, keep the default selection<b>Add new items if present</b>. To only update existing rows, changethat to <b>Ignore new items</b>.</p><p>To upload changes to a single table in TAB-delimited format,select a TAB-delimited file to send to Interchange by clicking <b>Browse...</b>,and a table to update from the list on the right. Then select whether toadd new rows from your file to the table, or to only update rows that are inboth your file and the table.</p><p>To upload changes to multiple tables in <B>Gnumeric simple-text</B> format,select it and use <b>Browse...</b>, then select your upload options.The table selection is not important because the table is selected fromwith the Gnumeric simple-text file.</P><P>Uploading in <B>Excel/XLS</b> format requires that the module Spreadsheet::ParseExcelbe installed on your server. Check with your admin if you need this andthe option is not present in the file format chooser. Otherwise, you simplyselect the <tt>.xls</tt> file with <B>Browse...</b> and upload as withGnumeric simple-text format.
item.edit	Items: Edit/Create	<p>The <b>Items: Edit/Create</b> page allows you to create or edit an item by filling in it's fields.Common fields include <b>Short Description</b>, <b>Long Description</b>, and <b>Image</b>, that are used when displaying an item on a catalog page, and <b>Product Price</b> and <b>Weight in Pounds</b>, that are used when calculating charges in the shopping basket.</p><p>The <b>Category</b> field can be used to select which category pages the itemwill appear on. Multiple categories can be selected. For more controlof product categories, choose <b>Site Layout</b> from the quicklinks menu.</p><p>The <b>meta</b> link, which is only visible to the Site Administrator or Super User, is displayed below each field name. This link allows the Site Administrator or Super User to change the parameters for each field. For more information on <b>meta</b> links, see the <a href="flex.meta.html">Meta Field Information</a> page.</p>
item.editor	Item Editor	<p>The <b>Item Editor</b> page displays a directory of the product items logged in your system. This page also allows a quick view of information associated with each item, such as SKU, pricing, etc.<p><h2>Features</h2><b>Limit with Search</b><br>Type the paramater by which you want to search the Item list. For example, type <b>14.99</b> to perform a search for all items priced at $14.99. Only the items containing the search parameter will be displayed.<p><b>Edit Checked Items in Sequence</b><br>Click this button after checking the item(s) you want to edit. The <a href="edit.item.html"> Edit Item</a> page is displayed for the first item you checked. Make the necessary edits and click <b>OK</b>. The <b>Edit Item</b> page of the next item you checked is displayed.<p><b>Delete Checked Items</b><br>Click this button after checking the item(s) you want to delete. A warning is displayed. Click <b>OK</b> to delete.<p><h2>Functions</h2>You can sort the item directory by clicking the heading of the column by which you want to sort. For example, to sort by price, click the <b>Price</b> heading. This displays the orders by amount in ascending or decending order. To sort in reverse order, click the <b>Price</b> heading again.Click a value listed in one of the following columns to access specific information about that value:<p><ul><li>SKU-click a SKU value in this column to access the <a href="edit.item.html">Edit Item</a> page for that item.<li>Quantity Pricing-click the value in this column to access the <a href="something.html">Pricing</a> page for that item.<li>Up Sell-click the value in this column to access the <a href="something.html">Upsell</a> page for that item.<li>Cross Sell-click the value in this column to access the <a href="something.html">Cross Sell</a> page for that item.<li>Promotion-click the value in this column to access the <a href="something.html">Feature</a> page for that item.<li>Inventory-click the value in this column to access the <a href="something.html">Inventory</a> page for that item.</ul>
item.main	Items	<p><b>Create New item</b><br>Click this button to create a new item.</p><p><b>Edit item</b><br>After selecting an item from the list, click <b>Edit Item</b>. Edit the necessary fields.<p><b>OK</b><br>To commit your changes, click <b>OK</b>.<i><b>Hint:</b> Using the browser's back button to exit the screen will not commit the changes you have made. </i><p><b>Delete Item</b><br>Select an item from the list that you want to delete, and click<b>Delete</b>. A warning is displayed. Click <b>OK</b> to delete. The deleted item is permanently removed from the system.</p>
knar.main	Knar Editor	<p>Knar stands for "Knar's Not A Registry." It's kind of like a registry.</p><p>The Knar table stores store-wide configuration information. If you don't knowabout store-wide configuration, it probably won't help you much. On the otherhand, if you just can't find the place to tweak the value you're looking for,it might be worth poking around (gently!) in here.</p>
layout.edit	Site Layout	<p>The <b>Site Layout Editor</b> can be used to manage the content on your site.Content is divided into sections, and you can create subsections of eachsection, much like directories and subdirectories on a disk.</p><p>Selecting a section on the left shows information about it on the right.Click <b>Create New Section</b> to create a new top level section, or select anexisting section and click <b>Create Subsection</b> to create a new section underthe existing section heading.</p><p>Sections come in three types: product pages, content pages, and links toforeign pages. In future releases of Interchange, you'll be able tocontrol many page attributes without having to edit the templates by hand.</p><p>Product pages are for listing items in your inventory. Generally, you'llcreate a section for each kind of item in your store, so that visitors canbrowse your items easily. If you have many kinds of items, you may want tolist their sections together under a <b>Products</b> section. When you've selecteda section that is a product page, you will be presented with a list of itemsin that section and options for adding and deleting items in that section.Deleting an item from a section doesn't actually delete the item from your store; the <b>Items</b> page is used for that.</p><p>Content pages are pages which primarily contain information about the site anddon't list any items. You can choose from pages you've uploaded with thefile uploader.</p><p>Links to foreign pages provide an easy way to link to another site.</p>
layout.main	Layout Manager	<p>The site layout manager is the interface that a designer or product manager uses to assign products to a page, manage elements on the page such as links, do merchandizing like specifying featured products, and rearranging elements on the pages.</p><p>When you enter this page, you see first a listing of the main pages linked on the front page of your Web site and other elements on that page such as featured products or navigation bars. We call these the "children" of the front page. If you click on the name of one of these children, the list will expand to show you the children of that element, and so on. Next to the name of each child is a radio button. Select the button of the element you want to work with before clicking any of the buttons at the bottom of the page.</p><p><b>Add as Child</b><br>You can add three types of children to any particular element: items, groups, and pages. The pull-down menus below the list display the available children. To add children to a page, first click the radio button next to that page's name in the list, then select either a group, page, or item from the pull-down menus. Click on the "Add as Child" button. You should see the new child appear under its parent automatically.</p><p><img src="images/layout.add.child.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="254"></p><p><b>Rearrange Children</b><br>The order that the children appear in this list is important, as it determines the order in which they will be displayed on the site. The "Rearrange Children" feature lets you place them in the correct order. First, click the radio button next to the parent whose children you want to arrange, then click on the "Rearrange Children" button. That will take you to a new screen with a list of all the children in order. Select each child that you want to move, then click the "up" or "down." Continue this process until they're in the right order, then click "ok." Clicking "cancel" will take you back without making any changes, even if you've already rearranged some of your products.</p><p><b>Move Some Children/Move All Children</b><br>If you want to move children out from under one parent over to another, these two functions will do that. "Move Some Children" allows you to choose which of the children in the list you would like to move, then asks you which new parent to assign them under. "Move All Children" simply moves them all. Below, see the "Move Children" screen. Notice you can "control click" to select more than one child to move.</p><p><img src="images/layout.move.child.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="210"></p><p><b>Hide All</b><br>Just as clicking on the name of an element will make its children appear, clicking on the name again will make them disappear. If you have a lot of different parents' children showing, the "Hide All" button will make them all disappear.</p><p><b>Delete</b><br>The delete button allows you to remove a child from the parent. Select the child you would like to remove by clicking the button next to its name, then click on the delete button.</p>

logout.main	Logout	<p>The <b>Login/Logout</b> page allows you to log in to the Interchange Administration Site. If more then one user has been specified on your system, this page can be used to log on as a different user. Enter your user name and password to access the Administration Site. If you are unsure of your user name or password, contact your Site Administrator.
matrix.main	Matrix Editor	<p><b>What is a Matrix?</b><br>A matrix is a table of all the possible combinations of options available for an item. For example, a golf club can have options for mens and ladies, right and left handed, several shaft types and flexes, different lofts, or head angles. But not all lofts are available in left handed, and some aren't available in ladies, and graphite shafts cost extra and all have different SKUs. The matrix contains all the variables. A simple matrix might be a size matrix, which has small, medium, large, and extra large. You would then be able to apply a unique sku or price or inventory information to each variation of each item.</p><p>A matrix can be specified for a particular item in the <a href="item.editor.html">Item Editor</a>, but each matrix must first be created in the Matrix Editor.</p><p><b>Create New Matrix</b><br>Here, give your new matrix a descriptive name, such as "drivers and fairway woods" or "build-to-order bikes."</p><p><b>Edit Matrix</b><br>This feature allows you to edit the name. To edit the matrix's dimensions, use the "Show Dimensions" feature.</p><p><b>Show Dimensions</b><br>This feature allows you to create new dimensions and create ranges underneath those dimensions.</p><p><b>Create New Dimension</b><br>Like the "Create New Matrix" feature, "Create New Dimension" simply lets you specify a name for the dimension. Each matrix can have an unlimited number of dimensions.</p><p><blockquote>Example: The "drivers and fairway woods" matrix will have dimensions for shaft type, flex, right/left handed, and loft.</blockquote></p><p><b>Edit Dimension</b><br>This feature allows you to edit the name.</p><p><b>Show Ranges</b><br>This feature will take you to another screen where you can create and edit ranges under that dimension.</p><p><b>Create New Range</b><br>This will allow you to give your new range a name. Each dimension can have an unlimited number of ranges.</p><p><blockquote>Example: The "flex" dimension of the "drivers and fairway woods" matrix will have range entries for light, firm, and stiff.</blockquote></p>
menu.edit	Menu Editor	Themenu editor allows you to manage menus based on the ITL [menu ...] tag.These menus are used to control Interchange's UI and for display ofproduct listings (typically for left-hand navigation).<br><br><h3>Menu Name</h3>A list of existing menus is displayed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Menu name: </span>&nbsp;dropdown. To load one, select it and press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Load</span>. There is a link to manage the files, i.e. delete a menu or download it.<br><br><h3>Menu Loader -- Single Table</h3>The menu loader allows you to pre-load a menu from a database table in one of three ways.<br><br>In Category mode, you have two choices of load methods. In the first,you select a pair of fields; one for the first level, one for thesecond level. A tree-based menu is built based on those two fields.<br><br>The combined category method uses a single field to develop the tree.That field must contain a colon-separated list of categories; i.e. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hand Tools:Hammers</span>. That would be identical in effect to having the <span style="font-weight: bold;">prod_group</span> field equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hand Tools</span> and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">category</span> field equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hammers</span>. The difference is that you can add arbitrary additional categories and the tree will reflect that.<br><br><h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menu Loader -- Dual Table</span></h3>This menu loading method allows you to integrate an Interchange 4.8.x menu developed with the Layout Editor. It reads the <span style="font-weight: bold;">cat</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">area</span> tables by default, and develops a menu based on your current settings in that table. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>If you change the settings of those tables with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Layout Editor</span>, you must reload the menu.<br><br><h3>Create from HTML</h3>If you have an existing piece of HTML that has a list of links, trypasting it into the text box displayed when an empty menu is loaded. Itwill initialize the menu editor.<br><br><br>
merch.build_related	Build Related	<p>You can mine the data from your <TT>orderline</TT> database to suggest products thatmight be bought in combination with a certain product.</p><p>All that is necessary is to access this page. The database will be mined andentries made in the <TT>others_bought</TT> field of the <TT>merchandising</TT> database.</p><p>The database is scanned, and a list of items purchased on the same order witheach item is built. This is stored in a data structure and can be accessed<I>in a shopping cart or flypage</I> with the code:</p><XMP>  [if-item-data merchandising others_bought]  [perl tables=products]    my $hash = [item-data merchandising others_bought];    my @ary = sort { $hash->{$b} <=> $hash->{$a} } keys %$hash;    return '' unless @ary;    my %in_basket;    splice(@ary, 3);    for(@{$Carts->{main}}) {      $in_basket{$_->{code}} = 1;    }    @ary = grep ! $in_basket{$_}, @ary;    return '' unless @ary;    my $out = q{    <BR><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH="100%">    <TR><TD __HEADERBG__>    <FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="__HEADERTEXT__">      Customers who bought this item also bought:    </TD>    </TR><TR>    <TD><FONT SIZE="-1">    };    for(@ary) {       my $desc = tag_data( 'products', 'description', $_);      $out .= q{<A HREF="[area $_]">$desc</A><BR>}    }    return $out . '</TD></TR></TABLE>';  [/perl]  [/if-item-data]</XMP><p>This code is used in the <B>Barry</B> and possibly other demos.</p>
merchandising	Merchandising	<p>The <b>Merchandising</b> page allows you to edit how the product items displayed are promoted. For example, you might notice the trend that customers who buy hammers also buy nails. Because of this, you might decide to use the cross-sell feature on this page to have nails displayed on the same page as hammers. You also might want to offer a discount to customers purchasing a certain quantity of one item.<p><h2>Features</h2><b>Limit with search</b><br>Type the paramater by which you want to search the Item list.

shipping.edit	Shipping: Create/Edit	<p><b>Name of this Method</b><br>This is the internal name used for the shipping method, and should be a single word, like "air1." The order you enter the shipping methods is the order in which they will be presented to the customer. We recommend starting with the most common or least expensive method first. Here are some commonly used names for various shipping methods: standard ground shipping, standard flat rate shipping, three day shipping, second day shipping, next day air shipping, International shipping, U.S. Mail shipping, etc.</p><p><b>Label for this Method</b><br>The name you specify here will appear in the list of available shippingmethods shown to shoppers when they place orders. Take care to makethem easy-to-understand. The name you enter should reflect the shippingalgorithm you choose.</p><p><b>Calculate Based on this Algorithm</b></br></p><p><ul><li><A href="shipping.price.html">Standard Shipping by Price:</a>shipping total based on the total price of the order. This can also beused to calculate a flat shipping price ($0 - infinity = $4.95) or a flatrate with big orders shipped free ($0 - 500 = $4.95 and $500 - infinity =free). The shipping charge can either be a flat charge or a percentage.<li><a href="shipping.weight.html">Standard Shipping by Weight:</a>calculates shipping by total weight. To use this method, you must enter aweight for each item in your inventory. You can use any unit of measureyou wish as long as you are consistent: if you enter your item pricesin grams then configure shipping with pounds, your customers will notbe happy when they are quoted huge shipping rates.<li><a href="shipping.quantity.html">Standard by Quantity:</a>charges an amount according to how many items are ordered.<li><a href="shipping.ups.html">UPS Zones-Based:</a>Interchange is pre-configured with UPS zones tables for ground, three dayselect, second day air, and next day air. </ul></p><p><b>Minimum Shipping Charge</b><br>The amount you enter into this field will be the minimum allowed quote forthat particular shipping method. For example, if you want to charge no lessthan $4.50 for ground shipping, enter "4.5" or "4.50" into this field.Remember, you must set the minimum for each of your shipping methods, if youwant each to have a minimum charge.</p><p><a name="additional"><b>Additional Shipping Calculation</b><br></a>Here, you can enter any additional calculation you would like to apply tothe shipping calculation. This is especially useful for the zones-basedshipping calculations. Very few merchants pay the full rates for UPSshipping, and some merchants want to slightly mark up their shippingcharges for handling. Other merchants may want to discount them slightlyto promote goodwill. This feature would allow you to discount your UPSground shipping quote by 25% to match your discount, then add $2.50to cover a packaging and handling charge. Tip: if you're currently notreceiving a discount on your shipping rates, call UPS and ask for one.</p><p>Although the shipping calculation engine that comes with Interchange isflexible and versatile, we realized that it still might not meet theneeds of all users. We decided to include a feature that would allowInterchange administrators to modify the shipping charges that werecalculated in a simple way. The "additional shipping calculation" fieldcan be used to enter a mathematical expression that will be applied toa calculated shipping charge. Here's how it works.</p><p>Every shipping method needs to have a shipping algorithmassociated with it. The algorithm could be "shipping by total cost,""shipping by quantity," or even a UPS weight based calculation.The administrator will typically have the option to set up severalparameters that the algorithm uses. The administrator then namesthe shipping method whatever he/she wants. All available shippingmethods are presented to the customer when he/she shops. Based onthe method chosen, a shipping charge is calculated.</p><p>The shipping algorithm calculates a "base shipping charge." That chargemay be modified by using the "additional shipping calculation" field.</p><p>Let's look at an example. Suppose that I want to implement a UPS basedshipping system. I create three shipping methods, and call them "Regular","Second Day Air," and "Next Day Air." Each method uses a corresponding UPSalgorithm that calculates the shipping charge based on the weight of thecustomer's order, the UPS rate and zone tables. Easy enough, but supposethat I have a special deal with UPS that gives me a 10 percent discount off thestandard rate tables, because I ship a large volume of goods. Obviously,I don't want have to manually edit the rate tables. Instead I can usethe "additional shipping calculation" field to automatically apply a 10%discount to whatever the UPS rate would have calculated.</p><p>In the "additional shipping calculation" field, I would enter the following:</p><p>x = x - (x * .1)</p><p>The character "x" represents the shipping charge as calculated by theUPS algorithm. Interchange will automatically apply the above formulato the shipping charge, and charge the customer the new total.</p><p>Here's how it would work for a real customer. Customer A enters the siteand orders 50 lbs. of goods to be shipped to Alaska by "Next Day Air." TheUPS algorithm determines that the cost would be $400. Interchange thensubstitutes 400 for "x" in your formula:</p><p>new charge = 400 - (400 * .1)</p><p>The resultant charge is 400 - 40 dollars, or $360.</p><p>Of course, we could have also written the formula this way:</p><p>x = x * .9</p><p>which would have had exactly the same effect. If you're a Perlguru, you'll be happy to know that you could also have written:</p><p>x *= .9</p><p>It is important to note that you must specify some sort of equalityon the left hand side of the equation.</p><p>You can enter any valid mathematical expression and you can reuse the"x" variable as many times as you need to. Interchange validates theexpression you enter, so if you make a mistake it will inform you,and the additional shipping calculation field will not be updated.</p><p>All invalid characters are stripped out before Interchange processesyour equation. This means that if you type in something like:</p><p>x = x * y + 300</p><p>the "y" will be removed, and Interchange will see:</p><p>x = x * + 300</p><p>which is an invalid equation.</p><p>Valid expressions include (but are not limited to) such things as:<pre>x = x + 5x = x + 5 + (x * .1)x = x - .75x += 2x -= (x * .25)</pre>etc.</p><p>As you can see, there's more than one way to enter any given expression.</p><p>Valid characters are x+-/*.()0123456789</p><p>If for any reason a shipping algorithm fails, the additional shippingcalculation will not be executed.</p>
shipping.main	Shipping Options	<p>The <b>Shipping Options</b> page allows you to specify and configure the shipping methods and costs for your online store. Before you begin here, you need to decide how you want to charge for shipping. We support all the most common shipping options:</p><p><a href="shipping.price.html">By Price:</a> shipping total based on the total price of the order. This can also be used to calculate a flat shipping price ($0 - infinity = $4.95) or a flat rate with big orders shipped free ($0 - 500 = $4.95 and $500 - infinity = free). The shipping charge can either be a flat charge or a percentage.</p><p><a href="shipping.weight.html">Standard by Weight: </a> calculates shipping by total weight with no regard to zones. To use this method, you must enter a weight for each item in your inventory. You can use any unit of measure you wish as long as you are consistent. If you enter your item prices in grams, then configure shipping with pounds, your customers will not be happy when they are quoted huge shipping rates.</p><p><a href="shipping.quantity.html">Standard by Quantity:</a> this is identical to shipping by price, but the shipping charge will be multiplied by the total number of items ordered.</p><p><a href="shipping.ups.html">UPS Zones-Based:</a> Interchange is pre-configured with UPS zones tables for ground, three day select, second day air, and next day air.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can choose a variety of these shipping methods, giving the customer a choice. Many companies use flat shipping for ground orders and use UPS zones shipping for second day and next day orders.</p><p><b>Create New Method</b><br>Once you've decided what shipping options you are going to offer your customers, click the "Create New Method" button and configure each option. You will be able to name and configure each option from the "Create New Method" screen. See the next topic, <b>Edit Method</b>, for details.</p><p><b><a href="shipping.edit.html">Edit Method</a></b><br>Select one of the currently existing shipping methods from the list and click "edit method" to change its name, enable or disable it, change the calculation method, or set a minimum charge. The "edit method" button takes you to the same screen as "create new method" button, but already filled out. To edit the individual charges for different prices or weights, use the "edit data table" function.</p><p><b><a href="shipping.data.html">Edit Data Table</a></b><br>The process of creating a new method is usually a two-step process. In the first step, you name the shipping method and devide on a calculation algorithm (by price, by weight/zone, etc). The second stage involves configuring your chosen method. The "edit data table" function allows you to change the particular settings for an already-created method.</p><p><b>Delete Method</b><br>Select a method from the list and click on this button to delete it. You will be asked to confirm your choice. If you choose yes, it will be deleted permanently. If you merely want to temporarily disable a particular shipping method and remove it from the list your customers see, edit the method and un-check the box next to "enable this method." That way, if you want to enable it later, you won't have to re-configure it.</p>

Of course, your business might have multiple locations or your state might have different tax rates by city, so you have the option of creating an unlimited number of tax rate choices. </p><p>To begin, specify the location to which the tax rate will apply. To create a new entry, click on the red <b>+</b>, then enter the amount of tax to be applied to orders which specify that location during checkout. If you need to delete any of the rates, of if you accidentally created too many fields, click the red <b>X</b> next to that rate.</p><p>If you require shipping or handling to be taxed, you should enable this by setting the Preference setting <b>TAXSHIPPING</b> or <b>TAXHANDLING</b> to the states where this applies.</p><p>Click <b>OK</b> when finished to save the tax information for this country.</p><h2>VAT based on country and category</h2><p>Here you specify the tax rates applicable to certain types of goods shipping to this particular country.

The field tax_category in the products table (hidden by default) is then referenced for each item when calculating the tax.</p><p>You will want to set up this same schema for all countries where the same tax rules apply, for example all EU countries.</p><p>If you require shipping or handling to be taxed, you should set a tax category of <b>mv_shipping</b> or <b>mv_handling</b> in the Tax Data.</p><p>Click <b>OK</b> when finished to save the tax information for this country. </p><p>If your company has many locations or your sales tax needs are very complicated, Interchange can be set up to work with third party tax software or your own custom code in a UserTag.<p>
